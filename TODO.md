## Technical Architecture Notes

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Platform connections
platform_connections (
  id, user_id, platform, credentials_encrypted, 
  is_active, connected_at, last_used
)

-- Scheduled posts
scheduled_posts (
  id, content_id, platforms[], scheduled_for, 
  status, created_at, processed_at
)

-- Enhanced cross_post_history
cross_post_history (
  id, content_id, platform, platform_post_id,
  status, metrics, error_details, posted_at
)
```

### API Structure
```
/api/platforms/
  /connect/{platform}     - OAuth flow initiation
  /disconnect/{platform}  - Remove platform connection
  /status                 - Get all platform connection statuses

/api/cross-post/
  /schedule              - Schedule posts for later
  /immediate             - Post immediately
  /batch                 - Bulk operations
  /status/{job_id}       - Check posting status
```

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Encrypt all platform credentials at rest
- [ ] Implement secure OAuth flows
- [ ] Add rate limiting per platform
- [ ] Create audit logs for all posting activities
- [ ] Implement user permission controls

## Daily Iteration Process
1. **Morning Review**: Check previous day's completion status
2. **Focus Session**: Work on current day's tasks
3. **Testing**: Validate completed features
4. **Planning**: Adjust next day's tasks based on progress
5. **Documentation**: Update README with new features

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Successfully post to 4+ platforms simultaneously
- [ ] <5 second posting initiation time
- [ ] >95% posting success rate
- [ ] Support for 10+ different content formats
- [ ] Zero security incidents with platform credentials
