# Electron Migration - Alby to Local Key Import

## Overview
When we moved from Alby browser extension to local key import for Electron, multiple systems needed updates. This document tracks all the changes required and their current status.

## Key Architecture Changes

### Before (Alby-only)
- Authentication: Browser extension (Alby) via NIP-07
- Key Storage: Managed by browser extension
- User Tracking: Based on Alby public key
- API Headers: Only sent Alby pubkey

### After (Electron + Alby)
- Authentication: Dual support (Alby in browser, local import in Electron)
- Key Storage: Encrypted local storage with AES-256
- User Tracking: Works with both Alby and Electron keys
- API Headers: Sends pubkey from either source

## Components That Required Updates

### ✅ COMPLETED

1. **Key Management (`/components/nostr/electron-key-manager.tsx`)**
   - Created new component for key import/management
   - Added encryption with `KeyEncryption` class
   - Proper nsec/hex format handling

2. **Encryption (`/lib/crypto-utils.ts`)**
   - Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption
   - Device-specific encryption keys
   - Session storage for decrypted keys

3. **Nostr Service (`/lib/nostr-electron.ts`)**
   - Created Electron-specific Nostr service
   - Handles encrypted key loading
   - Signs events locally
   - Migration from old unencrypted format

4. **API Client (`/lib/api-client.ts`)**
   - Updated to check Electron keys first
   - Falls back to Alby if no Electron key
   - Sends proper pubkey header for user tracking

5. **Main Page (`/app/page.tsx`)**
   - Added `hasNostrAccess` variable (Alby OR Electron)
   - Updated all `isConnected` checks
   - Fixed download form enablement
   - Updated messaging for Electron

6. **Content List (`/components/content/content-list.tsx`)**
   - Added Electron key detection
   - Updated empty states with proper messaging
   - Added "Back" button for key import navigation
   - Fixed Nostr posting to use local signing

7. **Gallery Page (`/app/gallery/page.tsx`)**
   - Uses updated ContentList with proper auth detection

8. **Unified Auth Section (`/components/auth/unified-auth-section.tsx`)**
   - Shows ElectronKeyManager in Electron
   - Shows Alby connection in browser

9. **Nostr Context (`/context/nostr-context.tsx`)**
   - Added Electron detection and key checking
   - Dual support for both auth methods
   - Proper npub formatting for both

10. **Connection Status (`/components/nostr/connection-status.tsx`)**
    - Different messaging for Electron ("Nostr Key Active")
    - Hide disconnect button in Electron (keys managed differently)

11. **API Routes (`/app/api/nostr/post/route.ts`)**
    - Accepts pre-signed events from Electron
    - Publishes without needing server-side key

### ⚠️ AREAS THAT MAY NEED REVIEW

1. **Other API Routes**
   - Check all routes properly handle Electron pubkey headers
   - Ensure consistent user ID handling

2. **Error Messages**
   - Review all error messages mentioning "Alby"
   - Update to be platform-appropriate

3. **Documentation**
   - Update user guides for Electron key import
   - Document security model

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Key import works in Electron
- [x] Encrypted storage verified
- [x] Download form enables with imported key
- [x] Gallery shows content with imported key
- [x] API requests include proper pubkey header
- [x] Content associated with user's pubkey
- [x] Nostr posting works with imported key
- [ ] Full end-to-end test in production build
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Storage**
   - Keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   - Device-specific encryption (not portable)
   - Session storage for temporary decrypted access

2. **Privacy**
   - Keys never sent to server
   - All signing happens locally
   - Clear messaging about security

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always do comprehensive impact analysis** when changing authentication systems
2. **User tracking systems** need to be authentication-agnostic
3. **Dual support** requires careful context checking throughout the app
4. **Clear messaging** is critical when security models differ between platforms

## Future Improvements

1. Consider unified key management interface
2. Add key backup/export functionality
3. Implement key rotation support
4. Add multi-key support for advanced users
